# Portfolio

A collection of development projects focused on full stack development with an eye for clean front end design.

My skills set includes a solid foundation in MySQL, JavaScript including jQuery and React, CSS, and HTML. I have used Git version control. I have also worked in WordPress.

In addition to my development experience, I have an education in Economics and hold the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. 

My solid people skills will be a welcome contribution to communications among team members and non technical clients alike.
